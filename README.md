#### Description

This is my final project for Cs50. This is Shortly. It is simple frontend project, Where you can shorten links. I use Javascript and JS library named React, also some html in react and css. In this project I also use bitly api for url shortening.I made a simple and good looking Navigation.In this web page you will see some logos with text. The main functionality of my web page is shortening links. It is well designed input with button. If input is empty and If you click the button nothing will happen because of it.
